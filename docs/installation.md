## Source

To compile *aws-nuke* from source you need a working [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) development environment and [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/).

*aws-nuke* uses go modules and so the clone path should no matter. Then simply change directory into the clone and run:

```bash
goreleaser --clean --snapshot --single-target
```
