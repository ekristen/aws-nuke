# Testing

This is not a lot of test coverage around the resources themselves. This is due to the cost 

## Unit Tests

To unit test *aws-nuke*, some tests require [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock) to run. However these mocks are
included in the source code already, but they can be generated by running:

```bash
make generate
```

Which is just a wrapper around `go generate ./...`.

To run the unit tests, simply run:

```bash
make test
```
