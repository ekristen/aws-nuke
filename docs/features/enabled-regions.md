# Feature: All Enabled Regions

There is a special region called `all` that can be provided to the regions block in the configuration. If `all` is 
provided then the special `global` region and all regions that are enabled for the account will automatically be
included. Any other regions that are provided will be **ignored**.

See [Full Documentation](../config.md#all-enabled-regions) for more information.
