# Releases

We usually release a new version once enough changes came together and have been tested for a while.

You can find Linux, macOS and Windows binaries on the [releases page](https://github.com/ekristen/aws-nuke/releases), but we also provide containerized
versions on [ghcr.io/ekristen/aws-nuke](https://ghcr.io/ekristen/aws-nuke) and [docker.io/ekristen/aws-nuke](https://hub.docker.com/r/ekristen/aws-nuke). Both are available for multiple
architectures (amd64, arm64 & armv7) using Docker manifests. You can reference the main tag on any system and get
the correct docker image automatically.
